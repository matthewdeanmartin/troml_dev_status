# Installation

It is highly recommended to install `troml-dev-status` into an isolated environment using `pipx`. This prevents the tool's dependencies from conflicting with your project's dependencies.

```bash
pipx install troml-dev-status
```

If you prefer, you can also install it with pip:

```bash
pip install troml-dev-status
```
