## TODO

- Config file support for application vs library
- Stress test against real world packages - started
- THREE implementations of iter file. Ugh.

## Design Flaw

## Docs

- Give a link to a page explaining how to fix each issue.

## BUG

- Case sensitivity bug in finding standard files


## Support for less common project layouts

- single .py file
- one package, many top-level modules.

## Support for getting dev status from all your .venv files.

- pyproject.toml missing but package meta info exists.
